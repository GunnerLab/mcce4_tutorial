## **Quick Introduction**

**MCCE4** is a physics-based computational biophysics program for predicting:

- **pK‚Çê values**
- **Protonation states**
- **Electrostatic properties** of biomolecules

In this program, protein side chain motions are simulated explicitly while the dielectric effect of solvent and bulk protein material is modeled by continuum electrostatics.
