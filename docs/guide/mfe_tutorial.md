# MFE tutorial 

## What does MFE do? 

MFE (mean field energy) Calculates the mean field ionization energy on an ionizable residue at a specific pH/eH. MFE provides the energy interctions of ionized residues and its neighbors. 

## Files needed 
Files needed to run this tool is **fort.38, head3.lst, pK.out, and sum_crg.out** 

To create these files please look at [pKa calculation tutorial](https://gunnerlab.github.io/mcce4_tutorial/docs/tests/ex2/)

## Usage 

If you have succesfully installed the  [MCCE-Tools](https://github.com/GunnerLab/MCCE4-Tools) you should be able to call the tool from any directory. 

```
 mfe.py -p 7 -c 0.05 HIS+A0015_

```

the -p flags defines at what pH the analysis is done. -c is at the energy cutoff that defines the energy minimum for residues interaction. 

## Output 

Output for the analysis should look like this for LysA1 in lysozyme : 


```

## Conversion of units
This output gives you the a varierity of the interactions of energy terms in differen units (pH, meV, kCal).

pH → energy (single proton):
	•	ΔE = k_B * T * ln(10) * ΔpH

pH → free energy (per mole):
	•	ΔG = 2.303 * R * T * ΔpH

At 298 K (room temp):

Energy in meV (single proton):
	•	ΔE(meV) ≈ 59.16 * ΔpH

Energy in kcal/mol:
	•	ΔG(kcal/mol) ≈ 1.364 * ΔpH

## Definitions of terms 

1) **Vdw0**: vdW interactions within the conformer (a side chain or ligand) + interaction with implicit solvent

2) **Vdw1**: vdw interaction of this conformer with the protein backbone

3) **tors**: torsion oenergy of the conformer

4) **dsol**: Loss of solvation energy compared with this conformer in solution. It should be positive as it is a loss in energy.

5) **offset**: energy term that can be freely modified

6) **pH&pK0**:  Solution pH effect on ionization. It is the environmental pressure on residue ionization. For an acid, low solution pH makes ionization (releasing a proton) easy, so it contributes favorable energy. For a base, low pH makes ionization harder. When pH equals the residue’s solution pKa, the environment pH is at a balance point, where the contribution is 0.

7) **Eh&Em0**: Environment Eh effect on redox reaction. This works similarly to pHpK0.

8) **-TS**: Entropy term.The number of rotamers of neutral and ionized residues generated by MCCE may differ. The effect of different rotamer counts on the two ionization states acts like entropy.

9) **residues**: Total pairwise interaction from other residues.
Other residues may shift the ionization free energy depending on their dipole orientation and charge.

10) **total**:Total pairwise interaction from other residues.

## Interpratation of the Data 

Whats the difference bewteen the Residue HIS+A0015_ pKa/Em=6.178 and the pka in the table? 

The purpose of the MFE calculation is to assess whether the ionized or neutral state of a residue is energetically favored at a given pH. Positive MFE values indicate that the neutral form is favored relative to the ionized form, while negative values indicate the opposite. In the results above, the van der Waals contribution slightly favors the ionized state of AspA170 in PSII. We can see that the total pairwise interaction also greatly favors the ionized form of APSA1170. This is chemically reasonable, as the residue must remain negatively charged to coordinate the positively charged ions of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC).
