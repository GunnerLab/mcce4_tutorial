# MFE tutorial: Extra Tool to help analyze pK.out NOTE: THIS TUTORIAL IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

 Continuing the anlaysis of lysozyme, we're going to use the results of a pKa calculation to perform a more detailed analysis of a specific residue, GLUA35, in Lysozyme. The goal is to move beyond raw pKa values and examine the energetic factors that determine the protonation state of this residue and how the pkA shifts according to the environment inside the protien. 

{: .important }
> **It is absolutley neccesary** that you run a [pKa calcualtion](https://gunnerlab.github.io/mcce4_tutorial/docs/tests/ex2/) to obtain the neccesary files to be able to use this tool. 

## What does MFE do? 

MFE (mean field energy) calculates the mean field ionization energy on an ionizable residue at a specific pH/eH. MFE provides the energy interctions of ionized residues versus its neutral form and quantifies them to determine which form is favored at a specific pH/eH. 

## 0 - Files needed 
Files needed to run this tool is **fort.38, head3.lst, pK.out, and sum_crg.out**. 

## 1 - Usage 

If you have succesfully installed the  [MCCE-Tools](https://github.com/GunnerLab/MCCE4-Tools) you should be able to call the tool from any directory. To use the program correctly you can look up the name of the residue of interest in the **sum_charge.out** and paste it in the command line

```
 mfe.py -p 7 -c 0.05 GLU-A0035_

```

The -p flags defines at what pH the analysis is done. -c is at the energy cutoff that defines the energy minimum for residues interaction. 

## 3 - Output 

Output for the analysis should look like this for GLUA35 in Lysozyme. Each term in the row has been defined in a short sentence:

## 4 - Understanding the Ouptut

MFE determines the energy interaction of the ionized and neutral form of the selected conformer (ionized form energy - neutral form energy). 

### Columns 

{: .important }
Each column represents the same energy interaction but in different units (pH, meV and kcal/mol) 

### Conversion of units for each energy term

At 298 K (room temp):

Energy in meV (single proton):
	•	ΔE(meV) ≈ 59.16 * ΔpH

Energy in kcal/mol:
	•	ΔG(kcal/mol) ≈ 1.364 * ΔpH

## In depth definitions of terms on rows 


1) **Vdw0**: vdW interactions within the conformer (a side chain or ligand) + interaction with implicit solvent

2) **Vdw1**: vdw interaction of this conformer with the protein backbone

3) **tors**: torsion energy of the conformer

4) ebkb:

5) **dsol**: Loss of solvation energy compared with this conformer in solution. It should be positive as it is a loss in energy.

6) **offset**: energy term that can be freely modified

7) **pH&pK0**:  Solution pH effect on ionization. It is the environmental pressure on residue ionization. For an acid, low solution pH makes ionization (releasing a proton) easy, so it contributes favorable energy. For a base, low pH makes ionization harder. When pH equals the residue’s solution pKa, the environment pH is at a balance point, where the contribution is 0.

8) **Eh&Em0**: Environment Eh effect on redox reaction. This works similarly to pHpK0.

9) **-TS**: Entropy term.The number of rotamers of neutral and ionized residues generated by MCCE may differ. The effect of different rotamer counts on the two ionization states acts like entropy.

10) **residues**: Total pairwise interaction from other residues.
Other residues may shift the ionization free energy depending on their dipole orientation and charge.

11) **total**:Total pairwise interaction from other residues.
