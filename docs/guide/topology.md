# 🧬 Creating Topology Files for MCCE4
---

## 📌 What Are MCCE Topology Files?
__MCCE4__ topology files (`.tpl` or `.ftpl`) define the **force-field and chemical parameters** used in __MCCE4__ simulations. 

They specify:
- 🧱 Heavy-atom connectivity  
- 🔗 Hydrogen placement rules  
- 🔄 Rotamer generation rules  
- ⚛️ Protonation and redox states  
- ⚡ Atomic partial charges  
- 🌊 Reaction field (desolvation) energies  
- 📈 Solution pKa values (`pKa, sol`)  
- 🔋 Solution midpoint potentials (`Em, sol`)

{: .important }
__The default system topology files are located in:__
```
  /home/user/MCCE4-Alpha/param
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ '/docs/images/mcce_toplogy_01.png' | relative_url }}" alt="MCCE Topology Overview" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

{: .warning }
> Without a topology file, __MCCE4__ **cannot treat ligands or non-standard residues** properly.


## What do you need to create a new MCCE4 toplogy file?
1. An ideal pdb structure for a molecule (RCSB, LigandExpo, etc)
2. Associated charge sets for given formal charges and conformation states of the molecule (PARSE, AMBER, NBO, etc). Examples of charge generators are:
   - [APBS](https://server.poissonboltzmann.org/pdb2pqr)
   - [Atomic Charge Calculator III](https://acc.biodata.ceitec.cz/)
   - [PDB Charges](https://pdbcharges.biodata.ceitec.cz/)
   - [OpenEye QuackPack TK](https://docs.eyesopen.com/applications/quacpac/index.html)
     - If you set up an openeye license, __MCCE4-Alpha__ has python scripts to generate chargesets using ```oe_assigncharges_QuacpakTK.py``` and
       ```oe_readOEBcharges.py```

{: .important }
> __RCSB__ will no longer support .pdb format so .cif files will be needed to convert to .pdb format for use in __MCCE4__
> 
> You may use the __MCCE4__ .cif to .pdb converter using the PyMol module for the conversion:
>```bash
>  cif2pdb_PyMOL EMH.cif
>```

## 🧪 1: Run ```p_info``` to identify unsupported non-standard residues or ligands
Enter the working directory for this exercise:
```bash
  cd mcce_workflows
  mkdir ex_topology; cd ex_topology
```

### Download the PDB file for:
```bash
  getpdb 3aox
```

### Run ```p_info```:
```bash
  p_info 3aox.pdb
```

Expected output should look like:
```
Number of amino acids in the protein: 307
This is a moderate sized protein. It will take hours to run.

Number of ligands in the protein: 2

We do not have topology files for these ligands:
NOTPL: ['EMH', 'EDO']

For more detailed analysis of the protein, look in p_info.log.
```

{: .important }
> **By default MCCE4** will create a file called ```new.tpl``` which contains *ghost* toplogies for unsupported molecules.
> This file contains the guessed connectivity based on inter-atom distances.

## ⚙️ 2: Generate template for a basic .ftpl (an MCCE topology file) for an unsupported molecule
For this tutorial we will be designing a topology file for the unsupported kinase inhibitor molecule [EMH](https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/EMH).

### 📁 Create a ```user_param``` directory and remove the ```new.tpl``` file:
```bash
  mkdir user_param
  rm new.tpl
```

{: .important }
> __MCCE4__ uses topologies files located in **user_param** in the working directory of a simulation in addition to and superseding existing the default system's topology files.

### 🔄 Convert your .pdb file into .ftpl: 

For this tutorial, we will design conformers for two different protonatation states (01, +1) for the __EMH__ molecule. 
```
  pdb2ftpl.py -p EMH.pdb -c 01 +1 > EMH.ftpl
```

{: .note }
> If you only have .cif file, use the __MCCE4__ .cif to .pdb converter:
>```bash
>  cif2pdb_PyMOL EMH.cif
>```

This will design a template toplogy file for __EMH__ which consists of entries labeled:
- CONFLIST:  Conformer types
- CONNECT:   Atom Connectivity
- CHARGE:    Unfilled placeholder atomic charge blocks
- RADIUS:    Default atomic radii values
- CONFORMER: Parameter stubs


## ✏️ 3: Fill charges for the template for the new .ftpl (an MCCE topology file) for the unsupported molecule
For this tutorial, we will fill in the respective conformer charges using chargesets generated with __Schrödinger__ suite software for ```EMH.ftpl```
.

Using your file editor of choice, fill in the "to_be_filled" sections with the appropriate atomistic charge for all conformer atoms.
Thus, changing: 
```

## 🔬 4: Calibrate conformer parameters

Depending on the type of molecule and it's conformational protonation states, we will need to calibrate a few things.
- Em0:  Electrochemical Midpoint
- pKa:  Intrinsic pKa
- ne:   # of electrons exchanged
- nh:   # of protons exchanged
- rxn:  Solvation
    - rxn02, rxn04, or rxn08 respective for solvation energy using a dielectric constant of 2, 4 or 8

{: .important }
> In this case, the only parameters we will need to calibrate are the rxn values and the nH values.
> Typically, __MCCE4__ topologies files always need calibration for at least one rxn (solvation) value 

### 👉 First, link the updated ```EMH.ftpl``` to your ```user_param``` directory:
```bash
  cd user_param
  ln -s ../EMH.ftpl .
  cd ../
```

### ▶️ Next, to calibrate the rxn values, run MCCE4 steps 1-3.
```
  step1.py
  step2.py
  step3.py -d 4
```

### 📊 Read the outputs of ```head3.lst``` column ```dsolv``` to retrieve the reaction field calibration value in solvent for a select dieletric constant.
```

### From ```head3.lst```, locate the most negative ```dsolv``` value per conformer type of ```EMH``` (EMH01 and EMH+1).

> The most negative ```dsolv``` value for each conformer type is used since it is most stable solvation energy for the conformer type in solvent.

### ✏️ Since we ran ```step3.py``` with a dielectric of 4, we can now update the ```EMH.ftpl``` for ```rxn04``` using a file editor of choice. 
Additionally, we can change the ```nH``` parameter in ```EMH+1``` to be 1 to indicate the excess proton. 

```
# Conformer parameters that appear in head3.lst: ne, Em0, nH, pKa0, rxn
CONFORMER, EMH01:  Em0=0.0, pKa0=0.00, ne=0, nH=0, rxn02= 0, rxn04=  -8.085, rxn08= 0
CONFORMER, EMH+1:  Em0=0.0, pKa0=0.00, ne=0, nH=1, rxn02= 0, rxn04= -21.009, rxn08= 0
```

### Rerun ```step3.py``` with the updated ```EMH.ftpl``` to ensure the calibration was successful. 
- If it was, the ```dsolv``` parameter should now be close to or is ```0.000``` for each conformer respective conformer.
- A negative value should not be present as it indicates the calibration was off.
Thus, your new ```head3.lst``` should look like:
```
iConf CONFORMER     FL  occ    crg   Em0  pKa0 ne nH    vdw0    vdw1    tors    epol   dsolv   extra    history

```

### Repeat calibration for other dielectric constants if needed. Make sure to test with ```step3.py``` to ensure its working!

## 🎉 Congratulations — you’ve created a __MCCE4__ topology file!
