# Tutorial: Creating Topology Files for MCCE
---

## Step 1 — What Are MCCE Topology Files?

MCCE topology files (`.tpl` or `.ftpl`) define the **force-field and chemical parameters** used by MCCE during Monte Carlo sampling.

They include:

- Heavy-atom connectivity  
- Hydrogen placement rules  
- Rotamer generation rules  
- Protonation and redox states  
- Atomic partial charges  
- Reaction field (desolvation) energies  
- Solution pKa values (`pKa, sol`)  
- Solution midpoint potentials (`Em, sol`)  

Without a topology file, MCCE **cannot treat non-standard residues or ligands**.

## Step 2 — Locate the Topology Directory

System topology files are typically stored in:

```
/home/user/MCCE4-Alpha/param
```
