# Setting the Stage

## Prepare the Tutorial Directory

For this tutorial, we’ll create a working directory where you can run the solver. We will work in a user home directory:

```
mkdir mcce4_tests
cd mcce4_tests
```

Prepare also the direcotries for the exercise:

```bash
mkdir ex1
mkdir ex2
mkdir ex3
mkdir ex4
```


This repository contains the source code (for those interested in development) as well as standard input files, which we’ll use throughout the tutorial.
