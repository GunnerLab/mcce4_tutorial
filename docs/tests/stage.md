# Setting the Stage

## Prepare the Tutorial Directory

For this tutorial, we’ll create a working directory where you can run the solver. We will work in a user home directory:

```bash
mkdir mcce4_tests
cd mcce4_tests
```

Prepare also the direcotries for the exercises:

```bash
mkdir ex1
mkdir ex2
mkdir ex3
mkdir ex4
mkdir ex5
```

This repository contains the source code (for those interested in development) as well as standard input files, which we’ll use throughout the tutorial.

Now you’re ready to start testing the core features of **MCCE4-Alpha** with practical exercises.

➡️ Let's start the first excercise [Exercise One](/mcce4_tutorial/docs/tests/ex1/).
