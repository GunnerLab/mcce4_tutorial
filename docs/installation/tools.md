# Tools Info
Many tools have a succint description in tools.info. You can list them all with:
```
 cat MCCE4-Alpha/MCCE_bin/tools.info
```

For more information about a given tool or executable python file, check the wiki, or use the "-h" flag, e.g.:
```
 step3.py -h
```

## MCCE4-Tools ðŸ”§

Check out the companion repository __MCCE4-Tools__ that provides post-simulation scripts and their codebase to process and analyze MCCE4 outputs and thus, do not require compilation of executable files or PBE solvers but an approriate conda environment.
