# Installation
There are two ways you can install MCCE4-Alpha, an automated install and a manual install:

## Option A: Quick Installation with Scripts
   - Keep the provided `mcce` and `delphi` (alternate PBE solver) executables compiled for Linux OS;
   - Use the semi-automated setup using provided script that download a generic NGPB image.

## Option B: Manual Installation with Executable Compilation and Creation of a NGPB Image Optimized for your System:
   - Compile `mcce` with or without that of `delphi`, and the creation of a NGPB image optimized for your platform.
   __Note:__ This option is necessary if you cannot run a simulation with an installation made with Option A.
