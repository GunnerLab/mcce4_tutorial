# Installation
Testing version of MCCE4 development. Please let us know about questions or comments! 

There are two ways you can install MCCE4-Alpha, which differ on whether a script is used: 
 * Option A: Semi-automated setup using provided scripts that download a generic NGPB image.
 * Option B: Manual setup that includes creation of a NGPB image optimized for your platform.
