# Installation
Testing version of MCCE4 development. Please let us know about questions or comments! 

MCCE4 is now using [NextGenPB (NGPB) from the Rocchia Lab (IIT)](https://github.com/concept-lab/NextGenPB) as its default PBE solver.  

There are two ways you can install MCCE4-Alpha, which differ on whether a script is used: 
 * Option A: Semi-automated setup using provided scripts that download a generic NGPB image.
 * Option B: Manual setup that includes creation of a NGPB image optimized for your platform.
