# Installation
Welcome to the installation guide for MCCE4-Alpha, a simulation tool for electrostatic simulations of biomolecular structures. This guide will walk you through the entire setup for Linux OS.

There are two installation options for MCCE4-Alpha, an automated install and a manual install:

[__Option A: Automated Installation with Scripts__](https://gunnerlab.github.io/mcce4_tutorial/docs/installation/installation_auto)
   - Keep the provided `mcce` and `delphi` (alternate PBE solver) executables compiled for Linux OS;
   - Use the semi-automated setup using provided script that download a generic NGPB image.

[__Option B: Manual Installation with Executable Compilation and Creation of a NGPB Image Optimized for your System__](https://gunnerlab.github.io/mcce4_tutorial/docs/installation/installation_manual)
   - Compile `mcce` with or without that of `delphi`, and the creation of a NGPB image optimized for your platform.

{: .important }
> This option is necessary if you cannot run a simulation with an installation made with __Option A__.
